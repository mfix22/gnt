# Contributing to `gnt` :cocktail:
Contributions all all kinds are welcome, whether it is code, issues, questions, logo design, bug-fixes, documentation, examples and more!

### New Types
You can add new types to `gnt` in one of two ways:
1. Add a new package to `/packages` and include tests and a `package.json`
2. Add a new dependency to `gnt` and expose it in `index.js`

### Before submitting a PR
1. If you are adding new logic, add or update the unit tests
2. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` and make sure there are no errors
